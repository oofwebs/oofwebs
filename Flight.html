<h1>Flight</h1>

<p>The idea of flight has been known to people since the first flying gods appeared. The gods had wings. It made them unique from others, they were able to do what no
other could- to fly. People back then gazed at birds and desired the freedom they were granted. The freedom to soar in the sky, unlike us crawling in the ground in such 
an inefficient manner. They designed promising flying machines, despite the unreliable knowledge of air, in which flight was possible. Some even unaware of it,
they believed in flight. If birds could do it, why couldn't we?</p>

<p>The idea of flight has been misleading nowadays, as people generally think of modern fighter jets, or a bird flapping its wings up and down. Flying refers to the state
of being supported by air, and moving through it. But this definition lacks distinction between the idea of flight we are already provided with since a very young age- airplanes
and birds. If flying were to simply move through the air, wouldn't throwing a stone make you an aviator?</p>

<h3>The wright brothers</h3>

<p>They were credited for the first successful powered and controlled flight and not for the first <i>flight</i>, as many people overlook. They used engines and were
able to stay in the air with sufficient thrust. People were very familiar with gliders at the time. The only difference was, gliders gain their speed by losing height,
they were accelerated by gravity. The Wright brothers' craft, however, was accelerated by the engine. They are also known for the invention of airplanes, but
airplane-like machines already existed before them.</p>

<p>Those machines were not able to come first in this race to fly with an engine, and it was too late before they made a successful flight. Many had lost their life
in this race. One of those pioneers was Otto Lilienthal, a German aviator. "Sacrifices have to be made." were his last words before he died in a glider crash.</p>

<p>Flying is being commercialized. We see airplanes the size of a building skim over us with ease. Mass production of such giants is not a result of mere curiosity and
attachment to flight. It is instead a way to build up the economy. Air transportation has been a major way of transportation. Despite its complications and expense, it is
preferred for speed.</p>

<h3>The air</h3>

<p>The most favorable fluid of all and a crucial gas for our survival, it is the air and has been for quite a while. Though air does not seem very hard to deal with in
our daily chores, it is very strong. Imagine turning those 10-ton blades on a windmill by hand! The air is viscous. It drags anything moving within it until it stops
completely. The air does not like motion, it opposes motion. There exists fluid friction known as air resistance. It is one of the reasons aircraft can fly, but is not much appreciated as
it opposes the craft's motion, making it harder to sustain its flight.</p>

<br>

<h3>Airfoils</h3>
<p>It's only a shape, but it's changed the concept of flight. Instead of flapping wings, people learned to glide through the air.</p>
<p>It is the shape of flight. It is one of those miracles people have discovered, like the idea of perpetual motion machines. It made it possible to convert horizontal motion 
into vertical force. 
<br>
An airfoil is similar in shape to a water droplet. It is thick in the front, decreasing in thickness till its sharp tail.</p>

<p>The edge in the front is the <i>leading edge</i>. The edge in the back is the <i>trailing edge</i>. The airfoil is divided into two parts, the <i>upper camber</i>
and the <i>lower camber</i>. The two cambers are like flipped images of each other. The <i>camber line</i> extending from the leading edge to the trailing edge divides the two cambers. The line describes the curvature
of the airfoil. The <i>chord</i> is a straight line extending from the leading edge to the trailing edge.</p>
